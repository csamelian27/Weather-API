Assignment

Create an HTML file matching the attached image that is reactive to the query string at the end of the URL. The query strings are 'zip_code' and 'dateâ€™. For example, if the file is index.html, it should be reactive to the parameters on, index.html?zip_code=10011&date=06/12/2019.


- Use the API data to create a page with the attached creative spec


- The 'zip_code' param on the index.html URI should be used as part of the API request


- The 'date' param on the index.html URI should be used to extract the corresponding forecasts from the API response. The API only returns a 5 day forecast so you can assume the merged in "date" will be within the next 5 days.


- Use Helvetica for all fonts instead of what is in the image


- The link to the icons: https://developer.accuweather.com/weather-icons.


- If the page must error out, it should appear as a blank page (completely blank)


- You may use jQuery
